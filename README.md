## About Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is not a specific algorithm, but a generic term for a class of algorithms. If used for comparison, it is similar to supervised learning and unsupervised learning, which is an umbrella term for learning.

The idea of a reinforcement learning algorithm is very simple: if a certain strategy can achieve a high score in a game, then it is further reinforced to continue achieving better results. This strategy is very similar to the various performance rewards in daily life. We often use such strategies to improve our game.
